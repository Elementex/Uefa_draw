# Uefa_draw
In light of the recent uefa draw (28th August), they drew the matchups using a computer program, tried to replicate that

here are the rules

>there are 4 pots, containing 9 teams each
>every team will play 8 matches
>a team will play any two teams from each pot
>a team cannot play more than two teams from a single nation
>4 matches will be at home and 4 will be away

now, the random element in this was that from a pot chits of teams were put in a bowl and 
a random team was picked up and its matchups were generated
